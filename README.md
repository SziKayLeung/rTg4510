# Transcriptome sequencing of rTg4510 AD mouse model

This directory is a repository of scripts pertaining to whole transcriptome profiling and targeted sequencing of rTg4510 mice.

## **Summary**
* Following global Iso-Seq transcriptome profiling performed on rTg4510 wild-type (WT) and transgenic (TG) mice using Sequel (PacBio), data from each sample (1 per flow-cell) was merged and processed using Iso-Seq3 pipeline, aligned to reference genome (mm10) and annotated using SQANTI3. 
* Following targeted sequencing of rTg4510 WT and TG mice across 20 dementia- and AD-asociated genes using Sequel (PacBio) and MinION (ONT), respective data was processed using technology-specific pipelines, and merged. 
* Merged transcriptome of 20 AD-genes further characterised using CPAT, FICLE...
* Differential expression analysis was performed at a global and targeted level to idetnify transcript expression changes associated with development of tau pathology in these mice

## **Datasets** 

1. Whole Iso-Seq Transcriptome (n = 12 samples)
2. Targeted Iso-Seq Transcriptome (n = 24 samples)
3. Targeted ONT Transcriptome (n = 18 samples)
4. Whole RNA-Seq Transcriptome (n = 59 samples)
